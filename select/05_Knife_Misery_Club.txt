Cut me open
Leave me on sight
Knife in your hand
Point it toward me again
Put me on trial
You have your way
Can I do this again?
Again you left me here to bleed
I feel like there's nothing left in me to go on
Stay up all night
Never see day
Light that you were is gone
Gone and I ain't coming back
I played the game once
I ain't having that no more
You were my light
Turned to a knife
Now I'm left here with scars

Give me one night and I'll give you my life
I put faith in you once and regretted it twice
But I know what you want
So I'm under your knife again
Again, again
If you tell me your name then I'll show you my face
You could love me the same and we'll never erase
And the light from your flame is our final embrace again
Again, again, again

Lately, I've been unstable
Don't know if I'm able
Ever see your face again
Cause when it's your time to shine through
It's enough to blind you
Hit me with your blade again
Cut open my chest
To see there is nothing left
Lay me down to rest, yeah
Watch my final breath, yeah

When I think I'm coming back
I feel better but it's strange
Thought I saw you from afar
You cast a spell on me, a charm
I wait for you in pain
Nights slipping and the light stays flickering time
Pour you water and I look you right in the eyes
It's not the same when I'm away
Girl, I need you face to face
Glad we finally got arranged
I'm saying, baby
Something keeps me separated
Something keeps me inside
Something keeps me in a lock box, tongue tied
Baby, listen when I say
You're forever what I want
I can't think of you enough
I promise that I'm coming 'round
Coming 'round
I know you are the best around
