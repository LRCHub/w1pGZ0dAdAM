Like a knife come to slit my ties to the past
To all the things which bind me to the grave, you came
You came in the morning after a long night
You came in the morning after a dark night

I stared into the knife. to see if it would hurt me
Threaten my life, use me and desert me
To a decision, I came.
I came in the morning after a long night
I came in the morning after a dark night

I took the knife, slid it under my belt
Was so surprised at the joy I felt
To come out of the mourning, I Came
I came out of the mourning after a long night
I came out of the mourning after a dark night

Like a knife come to slit our ties to the past
To all the things which bind us to the grave, we came
We came in the morning alter a long night
We came in the morning after a dark night
