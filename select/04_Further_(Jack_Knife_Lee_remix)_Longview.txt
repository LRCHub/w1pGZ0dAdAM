And the same when autumn comes
Cold air I breathe in my lungs
Something's new but nothing's changed
Familiar feelings just the same

Soon too the warm air comes by
Lie back and stare at blue skies
Thinking back away and from
When I'll be here and you'll be gone

Further, further
Further, further
Further, further from me

God's love will save our light and we'll come shining bright
God's love will save our sun and thy will be done

I think now of summers high
And reminisce on past times gone by
Only remembered now in
Earth, trees, the stars that have been there

And there forever held
Kept safe but memories never told
But felt if you went by
In never changing sky, and we'll be gone
We'll be gone

Further, further
Further, further
Further, further

God's love will save our light and we'll come shining bright
God's love will save our sun and thy will be done
God's love will save our light and we'll come shining bright
God's love will save our sun and thy will be done

God's light will save us
God's light will save us

God's love will save our light and we'll come shining bright
God's love will save our sun and thy will be done
God's love will save our light and we'll come shining bright
God's love will save our sun and thy will be done
